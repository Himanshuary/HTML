    <h1>Chicken</h1>

    <p>
        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species
        such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a
        term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a
        capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
    </p>

    <p>
        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
        Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
        (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.[11][12]

        Other terms are:

        Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[13][14]
        Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
